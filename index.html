          <h3>CRACKDOWN: A PAYDAY 2 Custom Difficulty</h3>
          <p>I am the lead programmer and one of two project managers for the Crackdown PAYDAY 2 difficulty. The mod seeks to create a custom difficulty for PAYDAY 2 from scratch while also implementing a custom Special unit, the Grenadier. The mod also comes with adjustments to some core AI behaviors, reworks of various vanilla special units, and a finely tuned assault wave configuration using knowledge gained from reverse-engineering the Group AI code.</p>

          <h3>TESLA ENGINE: Space Station 13 Project</h3>
          <p>I proposed this feature to /tg/station as a lag reduction method. At the time, we were having serious issues with the previous power supply(a gigantic black hole that eats everything and emits radiation) causing severe lag upon being unleashed upon the station. This was proposed as the alternative power supply and was quickly adopted and implemented into a variety of maps as the standard, until the Supermatter power supply was developed later on.</p>

          <h3>PAYDAY 2: Voiceline Framework</h3>
          <p>With Restoration Mod and Crackdown both having need for a good voice acting implementation framework to give the Grenadier a voice, a unified framework mod was created to avoid code duplication and ensure anyone can easily add custom voice acting to any unit using SuperBLT's XAudio integration.</p>

          <h3>Goal Oriented Action Planning: Space Station 13 (scrapped)</h3>
          <p>A previous developer had attempted to produce a working GOAP implementation along the design document published at http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html but, however, was unable to accomplish the project. I volunteered to finish it and fix the bugs plaguing it, but in the end despite fixing the GOAP implementation itself to work, due to some core engine issues that we weren't allowed to fix ourselves, we simply couldn't achieve the speedy pathfinding needed to make GOAP worthwhile. I also had a dead GPU at the time, which didn't help matters.</p>

          <h3>Team Combat Framework: A failed experimental "game"</h3>
          <p>Using Garry's Mod to speed up prototyping of the concept, I attempted to create a simple framework/game for creative players and server owners to easily create themed team vs team battles with various objectives and gamemodes without having to do the heavy lifting of ensuring teams work properly, creating basic gamemodes, etc. The project was developed cooperatively by myself and another developer, but we parted ways early on due to creative differences. The project did not take off with server owners, as they couldn't find a way to monetize it, so it wasn't developed past the prototype and two proof of concept uses of the framework.</p>
